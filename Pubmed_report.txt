# Report: PubMed Research Paper Fetcher

## Approach
The project implements a command-line program and a Python module to fetch research papers from PubMed. The process involves:
1. Using the PubMed API to search for papers matching a user-specified query.
2. Fetching paper details based on PubMed IDs.
3. Filtering authors with affiliations to pharmaceutical or biotech companies.
4. Exporting results to a CSV file.

## Methodology
- **API Interaction**: Utilized PubMed's `esearch` and `esummary` endpoints.
- **Data Filtering**: Applied heuristics to determine non-academic affiliations based on keywords (e.g., "university", "hospital").
- **Error Handling**: Ensured robust handling of API errors, invalid responses, and missing fields.

## Results
The solution supports flexible queries and outputs well-structured CSV files. Testing showed successful filtering and identification of non-academic authors.

## Tools Used
- **Programming**: Python 3.8+
- **Dependency Management**: Poetry
- **Version Control**: Git
